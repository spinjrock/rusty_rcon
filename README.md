# Rusty RCON

## A Quick And Dirty Rust RCON Client

### Why
Well, I needed a way to interact with containerized minecraft servers that wasn't a janky, tmux or screen session.
I looked at the existing rcon clients, and they are great, but it's more fun to write my own.

### Disclaimer
I wrote this in a few hours, it's scuffed and may not get much better in the future. Use at your own risk.
Also RCON is **not** encrypted, do not use this over the internet.
